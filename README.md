#There is one data file made available for reproducibility purposes:

#FECO23_DATA.csv

#This file contains metadata associated with each plot. The following columns are included:

PlotID: unique plot identifier  
Reburn: identifier if plot is reburn or not (YES/NO)  
Reb_Type: identifier of type of reburn with 3 levels: non reburn, SR (stand replacing first fire), or non SR (non stand replacing first fire)  
EW_Cascades: identifier if plot is located East or West of Cascade Range  
needle: mean dead needle index values per plot between 1 and 7  
prop_kBA: killed basal area per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1  
prop_kSTEM: killed stems per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1  
prop_meanbolescorch: mean killed bole scorch per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1  
prop_meancharht: mean char height per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1  
prop_surfcharmean: mean surface char per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1  
mean_deepchar: mean deep char index value per plot between 0 and 2  
PlotCBI_mean: mean total plot CBI value between 0 and 3  
Prop_lccloss: mean live canopy cover loss as a proportion between 0 and 1  
RBR: relativized burn ratio value as calculated with Google Earth Engine code   
DNBR: differenced normalized burn ratio value as calculated with Google Earth Engine code  
RDNBR: relative differenced normalized burn ratio value as calculated with Google Earth Engine code
